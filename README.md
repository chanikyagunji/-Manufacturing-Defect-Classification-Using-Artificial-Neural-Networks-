# -Manufacturing-Defect-Classification-Using-Artificial-Neural-Networks-
 Deep learning project for multi-class manufacturing defect classification using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN).
Project Overview
This project uses Deep Learning and Computer Vision techniques to automatically detect defects in manufacturing products from images. The goal is to reduce manual inspection, improve accuracy, and increase production efficiency by identifying defective items in real time.

The model classifies products as:

✅ Normal (Non-defective)

❌ Defective

🧠 Technologies Used
Python

TensorFlow / Keras

OpenCV

NumPy

Matplotlib

Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

Dataset
The project uses a manufacturing defect image dataset containing:

Defective product images

Non-defective product images
