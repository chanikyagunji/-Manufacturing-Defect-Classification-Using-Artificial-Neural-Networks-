# -Manufacturing-Defect-Classification-Using-Artificial-Neural-Networks-
 Deep learning project for multi-class manufacturing defect classification using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN).
Project Overview
This project uses Deep Learning and Computer Vision techniques to automatically detect defects in manufacturing products from images. The goal is to reduce manual inspection, improve accuracy, and increase production efficiency by identifying defective items in real time.

The model classifies products as:

✅ Normal (Non-defective)

❌ Defective
